# React-5x5-stronglift
This is a simple 5x5 stronglift front end app.

How to use this app
1. get the repo
2. npm install && npm start in your localhost
3. enjoy!

This was mainly constructed for learning purposes. Meaning that some part and hooks are not really that relevant.
What can be imporved is DRY principle which is really poor in Exercise components. Also file structure is really loose as of now.

All contributions are welcomed!
